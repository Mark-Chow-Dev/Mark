# Mark's CSS Learning Journey 🚀

This repository is dedicated to my journey of becoming a professional Web Developer. It contains my daily practices, projects, and notes as I transition into a full-time remote contractor.

## 🎯 Current Goals
- Master CSS Layouts (Flexbox, Grid)
- Build a professional portfolio for remote work
- Maintain consistent daily contributions (Lighting up the green tiles!)

## 🛠 Project Structure
- `externalstyles.css`: Practicing external CSS linking and selector hierarchies.
- `index.html`: Main practice file for HTML structure.

## 📜 Motto
"Where there's a will, there's a way."
